## Introduction

XGEN (BLIP3) is designed to provide efficient and accurate (lol to a degree) autocaptioning capabilities. This repository aims to set up the necessary environment and some tools to leverage the power of the XGen-MM-PHI3 model from Salesforce.

## Setup
(TESTED ON UBUNTU 22.04 | CUDA 12.1 | Torch 2.3.1+cu121) <br>
*For windows, lmk. I'll make a pull request to actually test. but should work fine.*
<br><br>
Follow the steps below to set up the project:

### Option 1: Manual Installation

1. **Create and Navigate to Project Directory:**
    ```sh
    mkdir blip3 && cd blip3
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. **Initialize with Git LFS (make sure to have installed. Ask ChatGPT.):**
    ```sh
    git lfs install
    ```

4. **Clone the Model Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/xgen-mm-phi3-mini-instruct-r-v1
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Run Tests:**
    ```sh
    python test.py
    ```

### Option 2: Using Setup Scripts

#### Linux/Mac:
1. **Download and Run the Shell Script:**
    ```sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C0nsumption/Consume-Blip3/main/setup.sh
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```

#### Windows:
1. **Download and Run the Batch Script:**
    ```bat
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C0nsumption/Consume-Blip3/main/setup.bat
    setup.bat
    ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can start using the BLIP3 autocaptioning tools. Detailed usage instructions and examples can be found in the [Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md).
